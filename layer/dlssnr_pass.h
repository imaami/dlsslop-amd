// The composition pass, on the layer's dispatch table.
//
// This is OptiScaler's DlssNr_Vk with the loader-exported Vulkan calls replaced by the layer's next-
// chain table. The build declares its storage images with an Unknown format for the actual
// RGBA8/BGRA8/FP16 targets; all shader arithmetic remains unchanged.
//
// Three things are worth knowing before reading the implementation.
//
// Every binding is written every dispatch. The shader declares all seven resources at file scope and
// branches on gMode, so all of them are statically reachable from the entry point and Vulkan requires
// a valid descriptor for each one whether a given mode reads it or not. Slots a mode has no use for
// get a 1x1 dummy rather than a null handle.
//
// Constants are slotted rather than overwritten. A single mapped uniform buffer would be wrong here:
// encode and resolve run in the same frame with different constants, and the second write would land
// before the first dispatch had read it. The buffer holds a ring of slots and each dispatch takes the
// next, at an offset the device's own alignment rule allows.
//
// Layouts are the caller's to declare and this pass's to respect. It never guesses what state an
// image arrived in.
