// The C++ constant struct and the compiled shader's cbuffer, pinned together.
//
// DlssNr_Common.h and DlssNr_Shader_Vk.spv are vendored as a pair from upstream, and nothing in the
// build makes the host struct and the shader's uniform block agree -- a member added to one and not
// the other compiles, links, runs, and quietly feeds the shader the wrong numbers from that member
// onward. The failure looks like a settings bug, not a layout bug.
//
// These offsets were read out of the vendored module itself:
//
//     spirv-dis DlssNr_Shader_Vk.spv | grep 'OpMemberDecorate %type_Params'
//
// If a re-vendor changes the block, this stops compiling and whoever did it is pointed at the one
// command that says what the new layout is. That is the whole intent: it is cheaper to re-read the
// offsets than to debug a frame that is subtly wrong.
