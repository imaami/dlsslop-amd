// An in-game key, in every environment this layer runs in.
//
// This is harder than it looks, because the layer has no window. It is a shared object inside someone
// else's process, and the three environments it has to work in do not agree on what "the keyboard" is:
//
//   X11 / XWayland   an X server exists, but not every way of asking it still works
//   winewayland      the game is a Wayland client; the layer is not a client at all
//   gamescope        a nested compositor with its own Xwayland inside it
//
// Two backends, measured rather than assumed on an XWayland session with a real key press:
//
//   evdev    reads the kernel's own input devices. Works everywhere -- a Proton game is still a Linux
//            process and gamescope does not sit between a process and /dev/input -- and has the lowest
//            latency. It needs read access to /dev/input/event*, which is root:input. Keyboards
//            deliberately get no uaccess ACL, unlike joysticks, because that would let any program
//            keylog, so this means the 'input' group and most people are not in it.
//
//   XInput2  raw key events selected on the root window. Needs no permission, and raw events arrive
//            regardless of which client has focus -- including when the focused client is a Wayland
//            one and no X client is focused at all. Verified with a real key from a virtual keyboard,
//            not with XTEST, which injects at the server and would have made this pass falsely.
//
// XQueryKeymap, which is what vkBasalt uses, was tried first and does not work here: on an XWayland
// session it reports nothing for a real key press. It is fine on a true Xorg session and that is
// increasingly not what people run.
