    // multiple of N.
    //
    // round trip does not divide the frame time, so those changes fall at uneven intervals. Each one
    // is a step -- the edit jumps from an old answer warped a long way to a fresh one warped a short
    // way -- and a step at an uneven interval reads as judder where the same step at an even one does
    // not. This pins the interval.
    //
    // What is paced is the send, not the collect: the answer is still taken up the moment it lands,
    // so it is as fresh as the round trip allows and the interval is pinned because each update is
    // the same round trip after an evenly spaced send. Measured on a 4000-frame pan at three passes,
    // the average answer stayed 13 frames old at every stride from 0 to 32 -- the cadence costs no
    // freshness at all, which is not what was assumed when this was written.
    //
    // It is also cheaper. Sending less often is less work for the helper, and the frames it stops
    // doing come back as frame rate: 577 fps at 0, 596 at 16, 675 at 24, 729 at 32 on that same run.
    //
    // A stride shorter than the round trip cannot be honoured and is not faked -- the send waits for
    // the next multiple at which the helper is free, so the cadence stays a multiple of N rather than
    // drifting off it.

    // How hard the measured displacement is filtered over time, in hundredths. 0 applies the estimate
    // exactly as measured, which is what happened before this existed; 100 is the full filter.
    //
    // The estimate scatters by a few pixels from frame to frame however it is tuned -- the search can
    // only name a cell, and the gradient solve refines within one rather than removing the cell-to-
    // cell instability. The edit is warped by that number, so the scatter shows up as the whole
    // picture shaking a different way each frame. Neither of the two obvious culprits was it: halving
    // the staleness did not reduce the scatter, and pinning the cadence the answers arrive on did not
    // either.
    //
    // the standard answer. It is applied to the velocity rather than to the displacement, because the
    // displacement steps every time a new answer moves the reference and only the velocity is
    // continuous across that. See PASS_SMOOTH in globalmotion.comp.
    //
    // Measured on a 2 px/frame pan, the frame-to-frame scatter in the estimate falls from 1.70 px to
    // 0.37 with this at 100, and the estimate tracks the true speed instead of stepping 0, 1, 3, 4
    // pixels at a time to average it.

    // How much of the chroma-agreement gate to apply, in hundredths. 100 is the gate as written; 0
    // switches it off and takes the model's colour everywhere.
    //
    // The gate exists because the model's colour disagrees with the frame's most at edges -- an edge
    // being precisely what it was asked to re-decide -- and taking that hue whole put one colour on
    // one side of an edge and its complement on the other. Measured, the pass moved colour balance
    // three to five times more at edges than on flat pixels.
    //
    // The cost of it is that where the gate closes, the composed pixel falls back to the frame's own
    // colour scaled by one luminance ratio -- so on a detailed frame the model's chroma detail is
    // dropped exactly where the model had most to say. That is a real part of "composition only ever
    // removes detail", and it was never separable from the colour strength control, because the gate
